Filter function is called with:

    ($ctx, $object)

as argument.  If it wants something else than the regular processessing
to happen it can return a hash describing the transformation.  Otherwise
it should return undef.

The arguments are:

    $ctx:    context object
    $object: reference to object visited

The context object provide this methods:

    object
    class
    reftype
    is_ref
    container_class
    container_self
    isa
    container_isa

The following elements can be used in the hash:

replace_with => $value

    dump the given value instead of the one passed in as $rval

use_repr => $string

    incorporate the given string as the representation for the
    current value

comment => $comment

    prefix the value with the given comment string

replace_class => $class

    make it look as if the current object is of the given $class
    instead of the class it really has.  The internals of the object
    is dumped in the regular way.  The $class can be them empty string
    to make Data::Dump pretend the object wasn't blessed at all.

hide_keys => ['key1', 'key2',...]
hide_keys => \&code

    If the $rval is a hash dump is as normal but pretend that the
    listed keys did not exist.  If the argument is a funciton then
    the function is called to determine if the given key should be
    hidden.
